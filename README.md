# Java Collection Framework & Streams – Practice Codes

This repository contains **practice codes and examples** related to the **Java Collection Framework** and **Stream API**.

It is maintained as a **learning and revision repository**, focusing on understanding core Java concepts through small, focused code snippets rather than full projects.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

### Java Collection Framework
- ArrayList basics
- Adding, removing, and accessing elements
- Iterating using loops, `forEach`, and method references
- Mutable vs immutable lists (`ArrayList`, `Arrays.asList`, `List.of`)
- Converting between arrays and collections
- Sorting collections using `Comparator`

### Comparator
- Custom comparator implementations
- Ascending and descending order sorting
- Comparator using lambda expressions
- Sorting based on custom logic (e.g., string length)

### Stream API
- Creating streams from collections and arrays
- `forEach`, `map`, `filter`
- Method references
- Basic stream processing patterns
